# About the project
These modules are made in accordance with the CPP-Modules, which are part of the Codam Core Curriculum. Each module introduces new concepts and contains a couple of exercises that gradually increase in difficulty. I was already familiar with C when I begin this project so that made some things a bit easier. The aim is to get experience with object oriented programming and C++. You learn all the fundamentals of OOP in C++.<br>
