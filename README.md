# About the project
CURRENTLY WORKING ON THIS. There will be 10 modules in total (00 until 09). This project is in accordance with the CPP-Modules project, which is part of the Codam Core Curriculum. Each module introduces new concepts and contains a couple of exercises that gradually increase in difficulty. I was already familair with C when I begin this project so that makes some things a bit easier to get. The aim is to get some experience with object oriented programming and C++.<br>

# Learnings per module <br>
**Module00**: namespaces, classes, member functions, constructors, destructors, stdio streams, initialization lists. <br>
**Module01**: memory allocation, new keyword, pointers vs. references, file handling/manipulation, pointers to member functions, switch statements. <br>
**Module02**: ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and orthodox canonical class form. <br>
