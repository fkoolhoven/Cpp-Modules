# About the project
CURRENTLY WORKING ON THIS. There will be 10 modules in total (00 - 09). This project is made in accordance with the CPP-Modules, which are part of the Codam Core Curriculum. Each module introduces new concepts and contains a couple of exercises that gradually increase in difficulty. I was already familair with C when I begin this project so that makes some things a bit easier to get. The aim is to get experience with object oriented programming and C++.<br>
